            Automobiles Ettore Bugatti was a German then French manufacturer of
            high-performance automobiles. The company was founded in 1909 in the
            then-German city of Molsheim, Alsace, by the Italian-born industrial
            designer Ettore Bugatti. The cars were known for their design beauty
            and for their many race victories. Famous Bugatti automobiles
            include the Type 35 Grand Prix cars, the Type 41 "Royale", the Type
            57 "Atlantic" and the Type 55 sports car. The death of Ettore
            Bugatti in 1947 proved to be a severe blow for the marque, and the
            death of his son Jean Bugatti in 1939 meant that there was no
            successor to lead the factory.
